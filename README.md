## About The Project
As part of the interview process at Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (BHHC) for the position of Senior Software Engineer, 
I was asked to create an example project to demonstrate my abilities as a developer. This is that project. It consists of an API
server built in .NET Core that collects and serves reasons that I would like to work for BHHC and a client web application that
seeds the database with a few reasons, and then requests and displays them.

### Built With
* [.NET Core](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/)
* [jQuery](https://jquery.com/)
* [jQuery UI](https://jqueryui.com/)
* [NUnit](https://nunit.org/)

## Usage
<img src="Images/SampleWebApp.png" alt="Logo">
The "Seed Database with Reasons" button puts 4 reasons that I would like to work for BHHC into the database, and then the "Load a Reason" 
and "Load All Reasons" buttons display the reasons specified.
